## Project Overview

Metropolitan Energy Center (MEC) is a nonprofit promoting energy efficiency, economic development, and environmental vitality in and around Kansas City. As the host of Kansas City's local Clean Cities Coalition, the organization works to assist fleets in converting to alternative fuels. Their projects improve air quality and reduce the use of foreign oil. MEC also takes an active role in reducing energy consumption of residential and commercial buildings by providing training, online tools, and low cost audits.

The aim of this project is to create a central database that consolidates MEC's data on the impact their programs have on air quality  and improving public health, and then to create a map-based interface to the data. This app will provide MEC with a means to summarize the impact of their work to their funders. It will also be used to increase the general public's awareness of local projects dedicated to improving sustainabilty.

This repository is only for front-end. Please check back-end repo in https://github.com/codeforkansascity/meep-backend.

## Installation


### With docker

If you haven't installed [docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/), go do so now. Make sure that you also install docker-compose.

1. from the project root directory, do ```docker-compose up --build -d```
2. In a browser, go to ```http://localhost:8080```. You should see the frontend running.
3. In another browser tab, go to ```http://localhost:8000/locations```. You should see a bunch of json served by the api.
4. When you are done working on the project, do ```docker-compose down``` to shut down the containers.

### Without docker

This assumes that you have already installed [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Clone the project from github ```git clone git@github.com:codeforkansascity/meep.git```
2. Change into the ```frontend``` directory.
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm run dev-server```
5. In a browser, navigate to ```http://localhost:8080```. You should see the app running.
